# AllRotationsEnable

This was an Xposed module that I created for my own use and published on the [official xposed repository](https://repo.xposed.info/module/com.jacopomii.allrotationsenable) in 2018.

Amazingly, it has been downloaded and used by hundreds of thousands of users over the years.

It enabled 180Â° rotation on Android 7.x (Nougat) and maybe 8.0 (Oreo), although I personally only tested it on my personal Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x running Android 7.0 on MIUI 9.

It was very convenient to charge the phone and use it at the same time without having hassles with the cable.

Recommended usage: install, enable the module in the xposed manager, restart your phone. It should just work.
